FoodFormula

Inspiration: We often have a bunch of leftover food in our fridges that goes to waste or expires because we don't know what to do with it.

What it does: FoodFormula finds recipes based on the leftover ingredients in one's refrigerator.

How we built it: We used HTML/CSS to design the front end design and layout and a python flask app for the backend. We searched through the Edamam API Recipe Library to find recipes.

What we learned: As mentioned above, we learned two new languages and how to use an API Library. We also learned that we should spend more time on deployment and that we should have managed our time better.

What's next for FoodFormula: Ideally, we would like to create an app that scans the items in one's fridge through the camera instead of people manually entering the items in their fridge onto the website. We would also have liked to finish our deployment and make the recipe format look prettier.
